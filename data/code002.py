#tank not only can move forward
#it also can rotate
#with "left()" and "right()" commands

#here we ask it to move a bit forward,
#to turn left and move a step more

forward()
left()
forward()

#try to add more commands to move it further
#and also to rotate it right (perhaps few times)
#note the two rules:
# - place each command on separate line
# - start each command at beginning of line

#switch to next level when you are ready!
